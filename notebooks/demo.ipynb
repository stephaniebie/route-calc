    "Now that we have a general idea of how `Location` and `Map` works, we can apply these to a larger data set. For the purposes of our project, we selected 10 locations in Boston, Massachusetts. To ease the user interaction with larger data sets, we have implemented two reader functions: `read_locations` and `read_routes`. The former takes in a path to a CSV file which reads in a list of `Location` objects. This can (optionally) be passed to `read_routes` along with a path to another CSV file which reads in the starting location, ending location, and duration of each route. If the list of `Location` objects is indeed passed to the function, it will automatically match a `Location` object with the corresponding name from the CSV file. The `read_routes` function then takes these routes and constructs a `Map` object from them."
